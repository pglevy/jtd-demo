# Comparative analysis

## What
A detailed review of existing experiences provided either by direct competitors or by related agencies or services.

## Why
To identify competitorsâ€™ solutions that excel, are lacking, or are missing critical design elements. Comparative analysis can give you a competitive edge by identifying opportunities, gaps in other services, and potential design patterns to adopt or avoid.
